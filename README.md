This is a continuously updated repository that documents personal journey on learning data science, machine learning related topics.

- **Goal:** Introduce machine learning contents in Jupyter Notebook format. The content aims to strike a good balance between mathematical notations, educational implementation from scratch (using Python's scientific stack including numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib etc) and open-source library usage (scikit-learn, pyspark, gensim, keras, tensorflow).
- **Short Note:** Within each section, documentations are listed in reverse chronological order of the start date (the date when the first notebook in that folder was created, if the notebook happened to be updated, then the actual date will be at the top of each notebook). Each of them are independent of one another unless specified.

#### unbalanced : 2015.11.25

Choosing the optimal cutoff value for logistic regression using cost-sensitive mistakes (meaning when the cost of misclassification might differ between the two classes) when your dataset consists of unbalanced binary classes. e.g. Majority of the data points in the dataset have a positive outcome, while few have negative, or vice versa. The notion can be extended to any other classification algorithm that can predict class’s probability, this documentation just uses logistic regression for illustration purpose.
